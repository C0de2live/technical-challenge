# Land Technologies Technical Challenge

## Guidelines

- Aim to spend **no more than 3 hours** on the challenge (hint - we're looking for informed decisions around scope, and a minimum viable solution instead of an "all-the-bells-and-whistles" solution)
- We are wary of your personal time and account for this. We would rather see de-scoping than hours and hours of extra work!
- We like simplicity... "less is more"
- We like elegant solutions
- We like tests
- We like clean, concise, understandable documentation (a `README.md` is sufficient) as an entry point to the solution. Remember "less is more", examples of things you may choose to include:
  - A statement of the problem and proposed solution
  - A link to the running application
  - How to run the application and/or tests
  - Technical decisions you made (both code and architecture)
  - Compromises / trade-offs / assumptions
  - Any other project code you would like to show us
- We would like to be able to run the code (as if developing locally (hint - simple readme instructions to get it running, or Docker or hosting etc...)

Please design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production then send us a link to the hosted repository.

## Challenges

The coding challenge is optional if you have some code that you're particularly proud of and able to share with us. Otherwise the challenges are below.

- [Sold Price Map](sold-price-map.md) - orientated towards Full Stack/Backend/Frontend/Junior Engineers
- [EPC Data Import](epc-data-import.md) - orientated towards Data Engineers

## How we assess your work

Your solution will be reviewed by our engineering team, taking into account your experience level and role. If you come in for an on-site interview please be ready to talk to us about your code, the decisions you made, and how you solved the problem.
