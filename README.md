## Submission guidelines
Please design, test, document and deploy your code as if it were going into production, then send us a link to the hosted repository and live demo if you can.

## How we assess
Your solution will be reviewed by our engineering team, taking into account your experience level and role. If you come in for an on-site interview please be ready to talk to us about your code, the decisions you made, and how you solved the problem.
