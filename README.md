# Land Technologies Technical Challenge

The coding challenge is optional if you have some code that you're particularly proud of, and able to share with us. Otherwise, please see [the challenge specification](sold-price-map.md) for instructions.

## Guidelines

- Aim to spend **no more than 2 hours** on the challenge (hint - we're looking for informed decisions around scope, and a minimum viable product instead of an all-the-bells-and-whistles solution)
- We like simplicity, 'less is more'
- We like tests
- We like clean, concise, understandable documentation (a `README.md` is sufficient). Remember 'less is more', but feel free to include:
  - A statement of the problem and proposed solution
  - The type of solution (front-end, back-end, full stack)
  - A link to the running application
  - How to run the application and/or tests
  - Technical decisions you made (both code and architecture)
  - Compromises / trade-offs / assumptions
  - Any other project code you would like to show us
- We would like to be able to run, or see it running (hint - simple readme instructions to get it running, or Docker or hosting etc...)

Please design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production then send us a link to the hosted repository.

## How we assess your work

Your solution will be reviewed by our engineering team, taking into account your experience level and role. If you come in for an on-site interview please be ready to talk to us about your code, the decisions you made, and how you solved the problem.
